    "# Exercise: PCA and K-Means Clustering on the Wine Quality Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the Wine Quality dataset, followed by applying K-means clustering to explore how wine quality can be grouped based on its chemical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset:\n",
    "The Wine Quality dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or accesss it from the \"assets\" folder. It includes data on red and white variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. For simplicity, you can focus on one of the wine types. The dataset features include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol level, and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "### Data Preparation:\n",
    "- Download the Wine Quality dataset.\n",
    "- Load the data using pandas.\n",
    "- Handle missing values if there are any.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PCA:\n",
    "- Standardize the feature data since PCA is sensitive to variances of the initial variables.\n",
    "- Apply PCA using scikit-learn. Choose to keep enough components to explain at least 90% of the variance.\n",
    "- Plot the variance explained by each principal component and the cumulative variance explained to decide how many components to retain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Means Clustering:\n",
    "- Apply K-means clustering on the PCA-transformed data.\n",
    "- Determine the optimal number of clusters using the silhoutte method by plotting the sum of squared distances for different numbers of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyze the clusters:\n",
    "- What does each cluster represent in terms of the original features?\n",
    "- How do the clusters differ in terms of average wine quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization and Analysis:\n",
    "Visualize the clusters in the first two principal components using a scatter plot. Color the data points based on their cluster labels.\n",
    "Try to interpret the clusters with respect to the chemical properties and the PCA components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Report:\n",
    "Summarize your findings about the wine quality segmentation. Discuss any interesting patterns that could suggest groups of similar quality wines based on chemical properties.\n",
    "Suggest how this information might be useful for wine manufacturers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools and Libraries Required:\n",
    "python, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn"
